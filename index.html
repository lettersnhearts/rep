<body style="background-color:black">
<p style="color:white;font-family:monospace">yes, this is happening.</p>
<p style="color:white;font-family:monospace">took me this long to finally say something but i will explain and i will skip dinner for this (not trying something).
	this is kind of a letter or shit cause i know for a fact that you like making them, but i made it as a website cause i feel like that's my way of saying i actually care about this and not just half-assing my bullshit.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p style="color:white;font-family:monospace">first of all, this is not an invitation for me to date you. i'm not pulling off shit here, i just want to atleast clear the awkwardnesss in the air right now (i also want to practice
	that finger typing kinda thing, so i could type faster. unrelated tho). second, you're not right when you said that it's not my fault. it is. you have made it super clear that i can talk to you after we, you know, but i just
	couldn't, and that's the mistake that i deeply motherfucking regret. pride kicked in and kinda stopped me from saying something to you. it's my fault we're like this, and i will make it right (or will not, depnding on your
	response). third, i don't know why i made it a list. (humor is here to atleast alleviate the awkwardness and shit)</p>
<p style="color:white;font-family:monospace">so, why did it take me god knows how long cause i purged that memory from my brain? cause it was killing me (and it wasn't even apparently obvious), i want to make things right. i wanted to leave the old yasc days behind, but
	let's be real, that won't be happening so might as well just apologize. i'm sorry this took 4 months to write, i have no valid reason for what i did. it kinda huts not because we ended it, i've accepted it cause i know it's
	my doing, but it hurts because i left you hanging, i guess. you're a good friend, and i don't know why i acted like an idiot. i've been planning to write you something for the past four months but pride, as always, had to
	kick in and stop me. this whole thing at this point of the letter-website thing feels half-assed because this isn't enough for what i did. it might seem small, what i did, but leaving someone for good for me is just not right for
	me. an asshole move is what i did. if it wasn't for that notes bullshit, this wouldn't be happening. but it did, so i thank that mysterious update for that (or wouldn't, if it took a hard turn). so that's the answer. tl;dr: cause
	asshole.</p>
<p style="color:white;font-family:monospace">i don't know how to make a letter, i don't know how to stretch it, but i do know that all of the things i said here are genuine (and in that weird notes conversation, can't get weirder
	than that).</p>
<p style="color:white;font-family:monospace">also sorry if i keep blaming myself, but i just can't help it.</p>
<p style="color:white;font-family:monospace">sorry also for that REAL WEIRD "i miss you" bullshit, idk if i was drunk or not, i could still comprehend what i was doing that time, but i guess i was too confident or something idk it's
	really weird and there's really no reason for me being creepy as hell. real sorry for that.</p>
<p style="color:white;font-family:monospace">i also kept the heart thing you made for me on display cause it's awesome and no it's never leaving there. i did however have to keep the letters away cause one flew below my bed and my bed doesn't have the underside
	thing open cause there's a drawer below my bed. a disappointing day. i think i said this in one of the paragraphs or sentences or wherever the hell it is but this is not an invitation to date you. i said it as well but i just want to clear the fog. you're
	awesome and i wanna catch up with you and idk, exchange stories or whatever the fuck friends do and shit.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p style="color:white;font-family:monospace">so, i guess that's it. we cool now? if yes, thank you so much. if no, i took a chance. this is also probably the most showoff thing i've done cause i put it on a site. i like making html webpages
	and i guess it's a better way of sending a chat to you. i took ict btw, not really somethink i think you wanna know but yep, computers and whatnot.
